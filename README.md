# BitConnector

The BitConnector is a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) Board, optimized for hardware-based, digital prototype design on a breadboard. 
The BitConnector is designed to represent a classic DIP chip in 2.54mm pitch with 2 * 20 pins. 
Configurations that are present in an HDL/schematic are transmitted via JTAG and stored permanently on the CPLD.
